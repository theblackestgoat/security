_____host discovery_____
Ping Sweep (from pivot box):
for i in {96..127}; do (ping -c 1 10.0.0.$i | grep "bytes from" &); done
NOTE:
You MUST calculate and replace the range, based off proper subnet calculation.
This is Bash syntax, hence you must enter it from a Bash shell.
Be sure to do this on ALL new subnets

_____host enumeration_____
Port Scan (from op station):
proxychains nmap -Pn -sT 10.0.0.X -p 22,80,443,2222,4444,9999
*NOTE: Dynamic tunnel must be setup on PIVOT host with access to range to be scanned.

_____host interrogation_____
Banner Grab (from op station):
proxychains nmap -Pn -sV 10.0.0.X -p 80
NSE Scan (from op station):
HTTP: proxychains nmap -Pn -sT 10.0.0.X -p 80 --script http-enum.nse
SMB: proxychains nmap -Pn -sT 10.0.0.X -p 80 --script smb-os-discovery.nse
